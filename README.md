## AngularJS Examples

This project is intended to demonstrate some key Angular concepts. Angular is a deep topic, and these examples are meant to be introductory.

There are two main folders. 

The first folder (section-one) is intentionally simple, containing only three files--index.html, router.js, and style.css. Scripts are loaded in-line in the index.html file, with the goal of making the relevant scripts accessible. The first folder is entirely client-side code. Just open the index.html file in your browser.

The second folder (section-one) is slightly more complex. It contains a client folder, node_modules, and a server folder. `cd` into the section-two folder and run `npm start` to run the server. Visit http://localhost:8080 to view the examples.
